#  Telecom Customer Churn - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📘 Overview
This project explores a **Telecom Customer Churn** dataset to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition (churn).  
The goal is to understand what drives customers to leave the telecom service and provide data-driven insights for retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics, usage patterns, and contract details.
- Identify key factors correlated with churn.
- Visualize important relationships using Python libraries.
- Derive actionable insights to reduce churn rate.

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle - Telecom Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
*(Replace this link with the exact dataset link you used.)*

**Data Description:**
The dataset includes customer information such as:
- Demographics (gender, age, partner, dependents)
- Service details (internet, phone, contract type)
- Billing details (monthly charges, total charges)
- Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🧩 EDA Process
1. **Data Loading & Overview**  
   - Inspected structure, columns, and data types  
   - Checked for missing and inconsistent values  
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing/invalid values in `TotalCharges`  
   - Converted categorical data where needed  
3. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Visualized distributions of numerical and categorical features  
4. **Bivariate Analysis**  
   - Examined relationships between churn and variables like `Contract`, `Tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`  
5. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Used heatmaps to study variable relationships  
6. **Key Insights & Recommendations**  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** showed higher churn rates.  
- **Higher monthly charges** and **shorter tenure** correlated strongly with churn.  
- **Senior citizens** and customers **without dependents** were more likely to leave.  
- Long-term contracts and **automatic payment methods** helped improve retention.

## 💡 Conclusion
The analysis highlights key churn drivers, helping telecom companies design better retention strategies.  
Next steps could include building a **predictive machine learning model** to forecast churn probability.

---

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Implement a **Churn Prediction Model** using Logistic Regression / Random Forest.  
- Build an interactive **dashboard** using Power BI or Streamlit.  
- Add **feature importance analysis** for explainability.
